PFAS Data Project
Data Topic - Local surface water PFAS dataset shared by Orange County Water District (OCWD) along with publicly available real time conditions for flows and elevation, watershed, precipitation and stream gauge data can be utilized to statistically analyze the data for correlation between variables, perform trending 2D and 3D visualizations of the data and understanding of the trend and it’s relationships with other variables.
Data sources:
•	Actual real-time conditions (water surface elevation in Corps dams, surface water flow rates, and recent precipitation): http://resreg.spl.usace.army.mil/cgi-bin/gMap.cgi?calP+24
•	  Historic data for US Army Corps dams in Santa Ana River watershed up to last 180 days (data depends on which dam - may be up to inflow to dam, water surface elevation, outflow):http://resreg.spl.usace.army.mil/cgi-bin/slLatestBasin.cgi?sar+elev
•	County of Orange has a website with precip data (ditto for Riverside and SB counties): http://www.ocwatersheds.com/monitoring/hydrology
•	USGS stream gauge data for CA: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/rt
•	Local surface water PFAS dataset – available on github repo link

PFAS: What do we know?

Introduction:
What Are PFAS? Per the EPA:
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. PFAS have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the globe, including in the United States since the 1940s. PFOA and PFOS have been the most extensively produced and studied of these chemicals. Both chemicals are very persistent in the environment and in the human body – meaning they don’t break down and they can accumulate over time. There is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse human health effects.affect growth, learning, and behavior of infants and older children (https://epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfas)

The Data:
Orange County provided PFAS readings from one monitoring well location on the Santa Ana River, near Yorba Linda. Our team downloaded additional monitoring information for Orange County, as well as precipitation data. 

What We Did:
Our team performed data cleaning, selection, and aggregation, as well some preliminary data exploration. We organized and prepared the data and explored different possibilities for future analyses.

Where This Project Could Go:
There are several possible avenues for future exploration. 
 •	An analysis examines the correlation between precipitation and PFAS detection levels
  o	Does it correlate with timing of rainfall event?
  o	Does it correlate with the volume of rainfall?
  o	What is the lag time between a rainfall event and PFAS detection?
 •	Is there a correlation between water temperature and PFAS levels?
 •	Based on any correlations above, can we predict where these chemicals will move in a given storm event?
 •	Based on any correlations above, can we make recommendations on where and when to monitor for PFAS?
 •	What about ground water?
