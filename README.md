PFAS Data Project
Data Topic - Local surface water PFAS dataset shared by Orange County Water District (OCWD) along with publicly available real time conditions for flows and elevation, watershed, precipitation and stream gauge data can be utilized to statistically analyze the data for correlation between variables, perform trending 2D and 3D visualizations of the data and understanding of the trend and it’s relationships with other variables.
Data sources:
•	Actual real-time conditions (water surface elevation in Corps dams, surface water flow rates, and recent precipitation): http://resreg.spl.usace.army.mil/cgi-bin/gMap.cgi?calP+24
•	  Historic data for US Army Corps dams in Santa Ana River watershed up to last 180 days (data depends on which dam - may be up to inflow to dam, water surface elevation, outflow):http://resreg.spl.usace.army.mil/cgi-bin/slLatestBasin.cgi?sar+elev
•	County of Orange has a website with precip data (ditto for Riverside and SB counties): http://www.ocwatersheds.com/monitoring/hydrology
•	USGS stream gauge data for CA: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/rt
•	Local surface water PFAS dataset – available on github repo link
